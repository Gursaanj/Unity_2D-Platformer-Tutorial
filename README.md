# Unity_2D Platformer Tutorial


This was my first Ever Unity Projects. Used purely as a way to learn Unity and C# Scripting. I was able to learn the UI of Unity 2D (how to make gameobjects, how to use the inspector, how to sort things in the Hierarchy, how to use the animator and scene views along same other basics) and the basics of unity scripting (declaring variables, Void Start, Void Update, Methods and controls and interactable public variables and so on)

This was later used as a perfect Beginners tutorial for many people in the club, AMS Game Development Association (AGDA). Where playtesting and going through simple scripting really worked out well.

Sometimes I come back to this project to test out protocols and methods which I will implement in some of my other Projects.
